    <p>
        When you post a job on WIYU, you will get candidates who we guarantee meet the following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Are certified by <a href="https://workforce.org/">San Diego Workforce Partnership</a></li>
        <li>Are eligible for wage subsidies </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        At WIYU, we understand that doing social good is important to your company. That's why our hiring incentive program will allow your company to get the public recognition it deserves for hiring from LMI communities.

        When you hire someone from our site, you will pay us 4.75% of their salary for each month the employee is retained, for up to forty-eight months after hiring them. This means that, if you hire an employee from our program for $50,000 a year, your company will pay WIYU $2,375 per year. This amount does not change if the employee's pay changes.

        Why would you want to pay WIYU 4.75%? Because, unlike other hiring sites, WIYU offers unique advertising opportunities for your company. Because of WIYU's unique relationship with the city of San Diego, we are in a position to offer packages such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Renaming streets</li>
        <li>Designating a holiday</li>
        <li>Putting advertisements in otherwise inaccessible places, such as public transit or parks</li>
        <li>...and more! We can work directly with your company to find an opportunity which works best for you</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For each dollar your company pays to WIYU, you will receive matching credit, which may be redeemed for the benefits listed above.
